# Covid-19
The purpose of this project was to analyze Covid-19 data, including case and death counts by country, in conjunction with the Human Development Index (HDI). 
The HDI is an indicator that attempts to measure a country’s standard of living by considering three different components: Gross National Income per Capita, Life Expectancy 
and years of schooling (measured as mean years of schooling for adults and expected years of schooling for children). By analyzing Covid-19 data alongside HDI scores, 
it is possible to not only inspect how the pandemic impacted standards of living but also the relationship between a country’s HDI score and Covid-19 experience. 
Specifically, this project sought to address the following questions:

  •	What is the mean/median confirmed case count? What does the distribution of confirmed cases look like?
  
  •	What is the mean/median confirmed death count? What does the distribution of confirmed deaths look like?
  
  •	How did COVID-19 impact different regions of the world?
  
  •	Is there a correlation between HDI scores and case/death counts

The data for this project was sourced from two different locations. The Covid-19 data was scraped from worldometers.info and can be found here: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/

The HDI data was obtained in csv format from ourworldindata.org and can be found here: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/human-development-index?tab=table
